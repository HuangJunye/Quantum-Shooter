This is a submission to [BOOOM! The 3rd GameShell Game Jam (2019Q3)](https://itch.io/jam/gameshell-19q3/rate/483660)

This game is inspired by the famous polarity shoot 'em up Ikaruga. The code used in this game were heavily borrowed from fellow PICO-8 games: [A PICO-8 Spaceshooter in 16 GIFs](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=3948) and [MONOID](http://takhtesefid.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?pid=40065).
